# Connect 4 in PyQt5 by Michele Del Zoppo

Got as an assignment for a job interview, and trying to have some fun with the tools I know.
Using PyQt5 and a full python application.  
Managing enviroment thru conda, all libraries are from open source channels [conda-forge]  
Miniforge3 is recommended, but not essential for building this application.

## How to setup environment:

1)  Create Enviroment:

`conda env create --file .\connect_env.yml`

2) Activate it

`conda activate connect_env`

3) Run it

`python __main__.py`

You could setup a debug mode in VsCode like I did, check the `.vscode` folder for the setup.
